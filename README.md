📊 Hands-on Learning: Excel Pivot Table & Dashboard Practice

Today, I worked on an Excel data analytics mini project where I explored how to turn raw data into meaningful insights using Pivot Tables and interactive dashboards.

🔍 What I practiced in this project:

Pivot Tables with Region, Salesperson, Year, Quarter & Month

Used Sum of Unit Price and Max of Quantity as value fields

Created interactive slicers (Region Manager, Salesperson, Order Date)

Analyzed region-wise and salesperson-wise performance

Visualized insights using Pivot Charts

📈 This exercise helped me understand how analysts quickly slice, filter, and summarize large datasets to support decision-making.
